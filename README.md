## Description

With being 2/3 complete with the Northwestern's full stack development program, I've given my Portfolio an overhaul. It now includes my skills, tools I like to use, and showcases some of my more recent works along with the technologies I used to build those applications. I chose projects that would illustrate the culmination of things I've learned thus far. There are few ways to contact me and see more of my work through the links provided (LinkedIn, GitHub, Resume).
